# Erland's server's rules
These rules must be followed by everyone. \
1: Griefing is not allowed. We record every interaction with anything and can rollback at any moment. \
2: Trolling is not funny. We don't want people to leave because someone trolled them. \
3: Use your brain. We don't have hundreds of rules because we trust you don't do anything stupid or annoying.
